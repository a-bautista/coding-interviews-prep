BFS approach: Tackle several topics where you are not that familiar. 
Time to spent: 1 month ~ 1 month and a half

Topic                 |  Priority
--------------------- | ---------
Array	                 High
* Sliding window
* Two pointers
* Traversing 
  from the right
* Sorting the array
* Precomputation
* Index has a hash key
* Traversing the array
  more than once

Essential questions
    * Two sum
    * Best time to buy and sell stock 
    * Product of Array Except Self
    * Maximum Subarray

Practice questions
    * Contains duplicate
    * Maximum Product Subarray
    * Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    * 3Sum
    * Container with most water
    * Sliding Window Maximum
